So uhhh, im using these resources:

plugin for gpx parsing to leaflet:
https://github.com/mpetazzoni/leaflet-gpx

leaflet:
https://leafletjs.com/examples/quick-start/


The site currently ONLY works with 1.gpx so uhh either use 1.gpx or edit the html. We can generalise gpx viewing later.
now that i know how to do leaflet layering (it's pretty easy i just suck) the rest shouldn't be too hard.

~Need to decide if the plugin is a reasonable way to parse the gpx
~Need to work on all the other site features....

~If someone could figure out how to display the other gpx values like the name and distance etc that'd be sick. there are functions in the plugin to do it i just cant get them to work
